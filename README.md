# advent-calendar
My first coding project was created on December 3, 2024, for my girlfriend's birthday. Used HTML, CSS & and JavaScript

ADVENT CALENDAR - THE FIRST PROJECT TO SEE GITHUB

Welcome to the Advent Calendar Project. Much of the boilerplate has been set up. 
Should you wish to use this template for your personal use, 
update all .pdf & .jpg/.png files with your own, ensuring the same naming format is kept.
(i.e.: 1,2,3,4,etc. for photos.

If the placeholder photos aren't hidden initially, you may need to clear your browser cache.

Hope you enjoy!
